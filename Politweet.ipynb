Hence, we attempt at using existing lexicons such as SentiWordnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After our exporatory data analysis stage, we found that there are very simple rules that we can understand from the different tweets. For example, \"-3 Obama\" is a notation that is used in the tweets to specify that the user disagree with something Obama has said, hence we can can collect rules of this kind and build a rule-based system for sentiment analysis. In addition, we plan to use the outcome of the different rules into a classifier and learn their weights."
