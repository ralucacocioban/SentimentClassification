"I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before,in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience and knowledge and judgment, and I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience, and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before, in this administration, to cling --SEN. OBAMA.(Chuckles.)SEN. MCCAIN.-- to a belief that somehow the -- the surge ha snot succeeded, and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge, is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.As far as other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that I'll take care of them, and I've been proud of their support and their --and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them,and I'll take care of them, and they know that I'll take care of them.And that's going to be my job.But also, I have the ability and the knowledge and the background to make the right judgments to keep this country safe and secure.Reform, prosperity and peace: these are major challenges to the United States of America. I don't think I need any on-the-job training. I'm ready to go at it right now."
