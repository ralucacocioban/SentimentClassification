"Yes, I think we need more troops. I've been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible because it's been acknowledged by the commander son the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing major offensive taking place -- al Qaeda and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.(View cut data) They are feeling emboldened.And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in,where in fact there was no al Qaeda before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is astrategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al Qaeda is the greatest threat against the United States and that -- Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front, the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though -- it's not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And I've said this to President Karzai.Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because al Qaedaand the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan across the border in the northwest regions and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe."
