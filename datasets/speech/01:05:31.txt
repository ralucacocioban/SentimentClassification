"Well, let me just correct something very quickly. Ibelieve that the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.I've consistently said so.What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq to deal with Iran.And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy. That was cleared away, and what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah.They have funded Ha mas. They have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously our policy over the last eight years has not worked.Now, Senator McCain is absolutely right; we cannot tolerate anuclear Iran. It would be a game-changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set up an arms race in the Middle East.Now here's what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. Ido not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation from countries, like Russia and China, that are -- I think Senator McCain would agree -- not democracies but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have anuclear weapon.But we're also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough,direct diplomacy with Iran, and this is a major difference that I have with Senator McCain. This notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran. It has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when I'm president of the United States."
