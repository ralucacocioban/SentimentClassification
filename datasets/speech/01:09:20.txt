"-- so he -- he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right as president of the United States to --to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I thin kit's going to keep America safe.And I -- I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history --the bipartisan history -- of us engaging in direct diplomacy. Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who along with five recent secretaries of State just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what? -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers.Now, understand what this means, ""without preconditions."" It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it mean sis that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you. There's a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course we've got to do preparation, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work because Iran is a rogue regime.But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran, and you know what, President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks, with the Europeans, around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.(View cut data)	And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea, let me just take one more example.In North Korea, we cut off talks. They're a member of the axis of evil. We can't deal with them. And you know what happened? They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke.They tested missiles. They pulled out of the non-proliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets potentially to countries like Syria.When we reengaged, because again the Bush administration reversed course on this, then we have at least made some progress. Although right now because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And I just, so I just have to make this general point,that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important. And Senator McCain appears resistant.He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain because he, you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain. Spain is a NATO ally. If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism."
