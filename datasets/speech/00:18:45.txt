"I don't know where John's getting his figures.Let's just be clear.What I do is, I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas, so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.I think those are pretty important priorities. And I'd pay for every dime of them. But let's go back to the original point.John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And absolutely we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track. And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think, that is a continuation of the last eight years.And we can't afford another four."
