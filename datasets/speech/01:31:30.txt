"Oh, there's no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone.In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaeda is resurgent.In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China,where we are borrowing billions of dollars -- they now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like --in regions like Latin America and Asia and Africa. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence,because we've been focused on Iraq.We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens. Not to mention -- look at our economy. We are now spending 10 or -- billion dollars or more every month. And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it. We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.There has never been a country on earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is anational security issue.We haven't adequately funded veterans' care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, how can I get disability payments?(View cut data)	I've got post-traumatic stress disorder and yet I can't get treatment.So we have put all chips in right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face that's been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore."
