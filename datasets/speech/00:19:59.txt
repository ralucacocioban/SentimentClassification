"Well, well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable.the business tax. Right now the United States of America business pays the second highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent.Now, if you're a businessperson and you can locate anyplace in the world, then obviously if you go to the country where it's 11percent tax versus 35, you're going to be able to create jobs,increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain and -- in the United States of America and create jobs.But again, I want to return, it's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you it's rife. It's throughout.The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day -- sometime next week -- with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at 'em. You'll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend, from$3,500 to $7,000, for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, anda lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of""rich."""
