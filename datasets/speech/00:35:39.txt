"Well, I want to make sure that we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan. I want the families to make the decisions between themselves and their -- and their doctors, not the federal government.Look, we have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. Iwould suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending programs that he has.We can, I think, adjust spending around to take care of the very much-needed programs including taking care of our veterans. But Ialso want to say again, a healthy economy with low taxes, with not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be av ital part of that.And the reason -- one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we're in today is because spending got out of control.We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending.(View cut data)	And if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budget slashed, they have not spent a lot of time in Washington."
