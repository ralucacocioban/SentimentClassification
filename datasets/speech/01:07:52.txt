"-- who is -- Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down without precondition across the table to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to aperson that is espousing the extermination of the State of Israel and therefore -- then giving them more credence in the world arena -- and therefore saying they've probably been doing the right thing because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger many times before he went -- look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be preconditions, and those preconditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face-to-face meeting a person like Ahmadinejad.Now, Senator Obama said without precondition."
