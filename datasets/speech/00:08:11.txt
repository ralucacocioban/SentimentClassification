"We haven't seen the language yet, and I do think that there's constructive work being done out there. So for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.The question I think that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? Two years ago, I warned that because of the sub prime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.So -- so the question I think that we've got to ask ourselves is,yes, we've got to solve this problem short-term. And we are going to have to intervene. There's no doubt about that.But we're also going to have to look at how is it that we've shredded some many regulations, we did not set up a 21st century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that, in part,has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."
