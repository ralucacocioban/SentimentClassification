"Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I'm Jim Lehrer of""The News Hour"" on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event, and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which by definition includes the global financial crisis.It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent -- no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind -- except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (Cheers, applause.)Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952presidential campaign. Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote.With that in mind, the first lead question: Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes."
