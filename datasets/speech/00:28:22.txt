"Well, look, look, we -- no matter what, we've got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. (Chuckles.)(View cut data)	The point -- the point is -- the point is we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies.I think that we have to return, particularly in defense spending,which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million and we still haven't done it.So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital,particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we ha veto get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison. So I know how to do this, because I've been involved in these issues for many, many years.But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them. And we'll have to scrub every agency of government."
