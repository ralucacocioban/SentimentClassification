"Jim, there are a whole of bunch of things we got to answer.First of all, let's talk about this -- this troop funding issue,because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable because he didn't believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable and was open-ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.(View cut data)	We had a difference on the timetable. We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.We had a legitimate difference. And I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing aparticular approach in the country, once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise?We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain in the rush to go into Iraq said, you know what; we've been successful in Afghanistan; there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.This is at a time when bin Laden was still out. And now they've reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges, the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we can't do it if we are not going to give Iraq back its country.Now, what I've said is, we should end this war responsibly; we should do it in phases. But in 16 months, we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put, provide some relief to military families an dour troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.And right now the commanders in Afghanistan as well as Admiral Mullen have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge."
