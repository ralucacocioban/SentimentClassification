And I know what our security requirements are and I know what our needs are. And so the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan. But we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect on Afghanistan and American national security interest in the region.Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand, there's a connection between the two."
