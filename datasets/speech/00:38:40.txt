"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear, that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.Our initial military success, we went into Baghdad and everybody celebrating, and then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said we've got to change the strategy.This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy, and I fought for it. And finally we came up wit ha great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded, and we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence, it would have been increasing sectarian violence, it would have been a -- a wider war,which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general,David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded, and we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home -- and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."
