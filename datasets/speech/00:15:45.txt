"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home states, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.But let's be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is afundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CE Os of Fortune 500companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.So my attitude is we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting apaycheck every day -- they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of -- of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow."
