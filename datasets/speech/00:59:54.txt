And they've -- our troops have performed brilliantly.The question is for the next president -- are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe -- precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan; we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11. They are still sending out videotapes.

And it is not true that you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. I mean, at -- at one point, while you we refocused on Iraq, you said, well, we can muddle through Afghanistan.You don't muddle through the central front on terror. And you don't muddle through going after bin Laden. You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something that we have to take seriously. And when I'm president, I will.(Cross talk.)"
