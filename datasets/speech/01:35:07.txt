"Well, let me just make a closing point.My father came from Kenya. That's where I get my name. And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States, because the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do, and this is part of our judgment -- this is part of how we are going to keep America safe -- is to, to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education; we are going to invest in issues that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States."
