"Sure. Sure, but -- but let me -- let me point outI also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess and CEO pay and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and Allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history -- still, to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.Somehow we've lost that accountability.I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street-- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption, or certainlya failure to carry out our responsibility, is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that'll happen."
