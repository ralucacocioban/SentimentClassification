"Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.Here's what I said, and if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that if the United States has al Qaeda, bin Laden,top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.Now, I think that's the right strategy. I think that's the right policy. And John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents ha veto be prudent in what they say. But you know, coming from you who,you know, in the past have threatened extinction for North Korea and,you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy.Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult. This is not an easy situation.(View cut data)	You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops, and we've got achoice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.And the problem, John, with -- with the strategy that's been pursued was that for 10 years we coddled Musharraf; we alienated the Pakistani population because we were anti-democratic; we had a 20thcentury mind-set that basically said, well, you know, he may be adictator, but he's our dictator; and as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime,they weren't going after al Qaeda, and they are more powerful now than any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. That's going to change when I'm president of the United States."
