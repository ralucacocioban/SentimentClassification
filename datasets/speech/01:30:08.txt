That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense, and it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand or doesn't get it that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages al Qaeda. They would establish a base in Iraq. The -- the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal regardless of conditions on the ground.MR. LEHRER.Do --SEN. MCCAIN.And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile. And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.That is a central issue of our time, and I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States."
