"I think it's much less than it was the day after9/11. I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others -- because I have worked across the aisle. Ihave a long record on that -- on a long series of reforms. But after9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission,and that was a commission to investigate 9/11 and find out what happened and fix it.And we were -- we were opposed by the administration -- another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came and they descended on Washington and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence, and we've got to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.(View cut data)	We have to work more closely with our allies.I know our allies and I can work much more closely with them.But I can tell you that, I think, America is safer today than it was in 9/11. But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.And I'd like to remind you also, as a result of those recommendations, we probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe.And that means doing a better job along our borders as well."
