"No, I, look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying apenalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go, and obviously stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job that has brought on this crisis.But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.But we've got to get through these times. But I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us."
