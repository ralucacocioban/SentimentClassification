"First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that Ir egret enormously, and that is after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region, and the result over time was the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the -- a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we can't ignore those lessons of history.Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, ""if you're going to aim agun at somebody,"" George Schultz, our great secretary of State, told me once, ""you better be prepared to pull the trigger."" I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan, so I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.Now, you don't do that. You don't say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.Now, the new president of Pakistan, Qadari (sic/Zardari), has go this hands full. And this area on the border is not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. I've been to Waziristan. Ican see how tough that terrain is. It's ruled by a handful of tribes.And yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy -- the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq -- that's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people, and it's going to be tough.(View cut data)	They've intermarried with al Qaeda and the Taliban. And it's going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in com batting the Tali pan -- Taliban and jihadist elements.So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops. And by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.So it's not just the addition of troops that matters. It's astrategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you, Iwould not publicly state that I'm going to attack them."
