"-- Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didn't happen to see that light there in the first three years as a member of the United States Senate. Nine hundred and thirty-two million dollars in requests maybe to Senator Obama is not alot of money. But the point is that you -- see, I hear this all the time. It's only $18 billion. Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it's gone completely out of control, to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people.That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.I have fought against it. My career -- I have fought against it.I was called the sheriff by the -- (chuckles) -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that along with his tax cuts he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.Now, that's the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes."
