"There is no doubt that it's going to affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it.The -- not only -- even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover; we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back. And that happened during the Great Depression, when Roosevelt purchases a whole bunch of homes. Overtime, home values went back up. And in fact, government made aprofit.If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen.But in the short term, there's an outlay. And we may not see that money for a while. And because the economy is slowing down, I think,we can also expect less tax revenue.So there's no doubt that as president, I'm going to have to make some tough decisions. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions, we've got to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are.(View cut data)	And if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them and we are leaving out health care, which is crushing on people all across the country, thenI think we have made a bad decision, and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long-term priorities."
