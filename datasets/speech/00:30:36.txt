We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurer sunder the Medicare system. It doesn't work any better through this private insurers; they just skim off $15 billion. That was agiveaway, and part of the reason is is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the prescription drug bill.They've done it with respect to Medicare.And we are going to have to change the culture. One of -- you know, Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrongheaded policies since -- that I --since I've been in Congress. But I think that it is also important to recognize that I worked with Tom Co burn, the most conservative -- one of the most conservative Republicans, who John already mentioned, to set up what we call a Google for Government, which says that we are going to list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is -- is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about."
