"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated. And it made me sad. And Iembarked on an effort to resolve the POW/MIA issue, which we did in abipartisan fashion. And then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries, so that our veterans could come all the way home.I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war. I know how to deal with our adversaries. AndI know how to deal with our friends."
