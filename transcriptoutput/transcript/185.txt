"Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia  His first statement was,both sides ought to show restraint -- again a little bit of naivete there He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petrol dollars that is basically a KGB-apparatchik-run government I looked into Mr  Putin's eyes and I saw three letters: a K, a Gand a B  And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War (View cut data)	I am sure that that will not happen  But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia It had everything to do with energy  There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey, and of course we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time  It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi -- where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili -- and they showed solidarity with him, but also they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian empire Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in -- in the -- the natural process, inclusion into NATO  We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement, they have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in,and there was a huge poster  And this is -- this is Georgian territory, and there was a huge picture of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin: our president "" It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia  They were just waiting to seize the opportunity So this is a very difficult situation  We want to work with the Russians, but we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion in keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior  And watch Ukraine  This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol and the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenkoand Yushchenko -- is a very serious problem (View cut data)	So watch Ukraine and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally "
