"-- Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States  He didn't happen to see that light there in the first three years as a member of the United States Senate  Nine hundred and thirty-two million dollars in requests maybe to Senator Obama is not alot of money  But the point is that you -- see, I hear this all the time  It's only $18 billion  Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years? Do you know that it's gone completely out of control, to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges  It's a system that's got to be cleaned up I have fought against it  My career -- I have fought against it I was called the sheriff by the -- (chuckles) -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee  I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that along with his tax cuts he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs Now, that's the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama  I want to cut spending  I want to keep taxes low  The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes "
