"Well, let me just correct something very quickly  Ibelieve that the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization I've consistently said so What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq to deal with Iran And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq  Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy  That was cleared away, and what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow  They have funded Hezbollah They have funded Ha mas  They have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon  So obviously our policy over the last eight years has not worked Now, Senator McCain is absolutely right; we cannot tolerate anuclear Iran  It would be a game-changer  Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set up an arms race in the Middle East Now here's what we need to do  We do need tougher sanctions  Ido not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation from countries, like Russia and China, that are -- I think Senator McCain would agree -- not democracies but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have anuclear weapon But we're also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough,direct diplomacy with Iran, and this is a major difference that I have with Senator McCain  This notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked  It has not worked in Iran  It has not worked in North Korea  In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons  That will change when I'm president of the United States "
