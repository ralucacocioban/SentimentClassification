"I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power Everybody who was around then and had been there and knew about it knew that it was a failed state But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that -- let me tell you my record  Back in 1983, when I was ab rand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon  And I saw that, and I saw the situation  And Istood up and I voted against that because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference  Tragically, I was right  Nearly 300Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks And then we had -- then we had the first Gulf War  I supported-- I supported that I supported us going into Bosnia when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia  It was the right thing to do to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe I supported what we did in Kosovo  I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there And I have a record In Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of So I have a record  I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involved the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad"" --Matthew Stanley -- ""before Christmas last year "" This was last Augusta year ago And I said, I will -- ""I will wear his bracelet with honor "" And this was August a year ago And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to"" do every-- ""promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain "" That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who reenlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed (View cut data)	And they all say to me that we don't want to defeat I know what it's like when an army is defeated  A war that I was in where we had an army that -- it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated  And I know how hard it is to -- for that-- to -- for an army and a military to recover from that "
