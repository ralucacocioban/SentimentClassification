"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and Ihave a fundamental difference because, I think, the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place Now, six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war, at a time when it was politically risky to do so, because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world and whether our intelligence was sound but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan  We hadn't caught bin Laden  We hadn't put alQaeda to rest  And as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction Now, Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment  And I wish I had been wrong, for the sake of the country,and they had been right  But that's not the case We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be a trillion  We have lost over 4,000 lives  We have seen 30,000 wounded  And most importantly from a strategic, national security perspective, al Qaedais resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001 We took our eye off the ball and not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, ata time when we are in great distress here at home and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched, and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government (View cut data)	So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not as president in order to keep the American people safe  But we have to use our military wisely, and we did not use our military wisely in Iraq "
